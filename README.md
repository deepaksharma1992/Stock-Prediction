# Stock-Prediction

This project is made during the Siraj Raval Make money with ML course.
The submission contain the Jupyter notebook and Apple stock list CSV file.

To run the notebook, open the Stock-Prediction.ipynb file in Jupyter notebook or Google Colabs by choosing Python 3 environment.

The project predicts the prices of apple stocks using Machine Learning and Deep Learning frameworks and making 
the plots using the Matplotlib python library.

The algorithms used in this files are -
1. Linear Regression
2. Ridge Linear Regression
3. KNN Regression
4. Support Vector Machine Regression.
5. Long Short Term Memory (LSTM)(Neural Network)

Technologies Used
1. Sklearn ML library
2. Numpy 
3. Pandas
4. Matplotlib
5. Keras
